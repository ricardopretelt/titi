## Description

Titi is an app of citizen participation where people can be informed, audit and check the realization of public contracts in Colombia, to avoid corruption risks and report true cases.

This project still on the early days but we are currently working on it. It is the result of the [hackfest](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/educacion-continuada/hackfest-contra-la-corrupcion) in an intense weekend and got the third price. For the event I coded the page but I got help from mentors to improve the design, also logos and icons were created by Isabella Jaimes.
The original group and creators of the idea are:
* Isabella Jaimes
* Suny Whitaker
* Dylan Stephan
* Jaime Ramirez
* Ricardo Pretelt

The project has other software parts but are not included in this repo.
